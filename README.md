# Overview
This program is a basic shopping cart program which allows the user to manage their cart. I provided a menu with multiple options, those being: displaying items for sale and their cost,
displaying the contents of the cart and the total cost, adding an item to the cart and the desired quantity, removing an item from the cart and the desired quantity,
saving the cart contents, and finally loading the saved cart contents. The program utilizes two different classes, the Cart class and the Item class. The Cart class keeps track of
the cart data, i.e. how many of each item is in the cart (if any), as well as how much each item costs and the total. The Item class is in charge of the items for sale and how much they
cost. By creating a separate Item class, I can choose to add or remove items from availability and choose to change prices at will as well.

The goal of this program is to practice the use of classes, methods, functions, and reading and writing to files in C++ and getting them to work together.
This is my first program in C++, and I wanted to create something that would stretch me.

Here is a link to a demo video of my program and its code.

# Development Environment
To create this program, I used Visual Studio by Microsoft.

This program is coded in C++. I used the C++ Standard Library and headers such as <iostream>, <fstream>, <sstream>, <unordered_map>, <vector>, and <string>.

# Future Work
It might be useful to keep track of files that have been saved to, in case the user forgets the filename they entered.
